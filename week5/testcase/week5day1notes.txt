Todays Agenda:
=============
   1)9:30-10:30->TestNG Basics
   2)10:30-11:30->Break+Classroom
   3)11:30-12:00->TestNG-Xml
   4)12:00-12:20->Classroom
   5)12:20-12:30->Recap
   
Limitations:
============
   1)One by one
       -Time consuming effort
       -Same data
       -Manually someone have to be present
       -Expectation:Run automatedly-Parallel
  2)There is no reporting
      -Expectation:Atleast a basic report(how many passed,failed,skipped)
  3)There is no way to filter the failed testcases
      -Expectation:automated retry
  4)To run multiple testcases    
      -Expectation:Automated grouping would be better 

TestNG:
======
   -Test Execution framework
   -Cedric
   
Advantages:
==========
   1)Sequential and parallel execution of multiple testcases 
   2)Gives the test execution status(Pass/Fail)
   3)Execute the testcases with mutiple data    
   4)Can Control the test execution with the help of annotations and attributes
   5)Retry the failed testcases
   
2 Step process:
===============
   1)TestNG as plugin(To run as testng xml file)
   2)TestNG as jar(To understand the TestNG Software)
 
Process to convert a Java code to a TestNG code:
===============================================
    1)Change the main method to a normal method   
	     -remove static
		 -remove the arguments
		 -change main to a meaningful name
	2)Add the Annotation (@Test) on top of the method
    3)Now,run the test!	
   
How to run multiple testcases through TestNG?
     1)select the testcasesthat you like to run together
     2)Convert them as TestNG->convert to testng
     3)This will generate testngxml file
     4)Click the XML file and open the Source tab

XML structure:
    Suite : All testcases together in a xml
    Test: Map it as a module of your application
