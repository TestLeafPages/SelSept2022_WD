OOPs:
==== 
   ->Object Oriented Programming Structure is a prgramming model based in the concept of "objects"
which can contain data and logic,data varibles and methods   
4 Different concepts:
====================
    ->Inheritance
	->Polymorphism
	->Abstraction
	->Encapsulation
	
Inheritance:
============
    ->It is the concept based on the relationship between two similar classes(parent-child) to have
the common functions 
   ->To avoid duplicate implementation
   ->reduce code
How you will achieve inheritance?
    extends keyword	
	
Types of Inheritance:
====================
   1)Single inheritance(Parent-child)
   2)Multi-level inheritance(Grandparent->parent->Child)
   3)Multiple inheritance   

Polymorphism:
============
   poly-many
   morphism-forms
  ->It refers to the ability of a class to provide different implementations of a method.
  ->Java allows us to perform the same action in many different forms. 
Types of Polymorphism:
   ->Overloading
   ->Overriding   
  
Overloading:
============
   ->when two or more methodsinside the same class have same signature execpt the input arguments
   Access modifier
   returntype
   method name
   ->Compile time
   
   Input arguments-No of argumentscan be different
                   Datatypes can be different

Overriding:
===========
  -> When two or more methods are within different classes but it should be inherited between them
and the signature is same but the logic is different
  -> subclass method overrides the behaviour of the parent class through inheritance
  ->Runtime Polymorphism
  Method is same
  Same arguments
  logic is different
