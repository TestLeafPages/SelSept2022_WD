Set:
====
  ->Set is also an Interface   
  ->It cannot hold Duplicates
  
Implementation Class:
=====================
    ->HashSet        -Based on the Hashing ALgorithm(random order)
    ->LinkedHashSet	 -Based on the Insertion Order(FIFO)
	->TreeSet        -Based on ASCII order(alphabetic order)
	
Methods of Set:
==============
    1)size()-> Number of items /ele
    2)add()->will be added to the particular index based on the implementation class
    3)remove()->remove a particular element
    4)clear()->remove all elements
