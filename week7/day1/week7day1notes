Cucumber-Behaviour Driven Development:
=====================================
    -BDD Automation tool
TDD:-
=====
  -Test Driven Development
  -Write the testcases first
  -Get the approval for the testcases
  -Development should be based on the testcases
  
  Cons:
     -Lot of negative testcases covered rather than the positive testcases

ATTD:=
=====
  -Acceptance Test Driven Development

    -Write the acceptance testcases first 
    -Develop the software based on the acceptance testcases

Cons:
   -Communication gap between Techical and non-Technical Team


BDD:
===
   -To address the communication gap between the tech and non-tech team
   
   -Write the acceptance testcases first using common language
      -common language:Understandable both by tech and non-Technical team
	
3 Layers of Cucumber:
=====================
    1)Feature        - File to write the BDD Testcases (flat file)
    2)StepDefinition - Implement the test step using Java/Selenium
    3)Runner	     -  TestNG for execution
	
	  
Gherkin keywords:
=================

     Feature    used to describe the functionality 
	 Scenario   Used to describe a testcase
	 Given      Used to represent  pre-condition
	 When       Used to represent the test step/condition
	 Then       Used to represent expected result for positive scenario
	 But        Used to represent expected result for negative scenario
	 And        Used as a conjunction when we have BDD keyword repeating consequtively
	 
	 
Runner:
   AbstractTestNGCucumberTests	 



How to parameterize the data?
 ============================
    1)Enclose the data in the feature file with single quote(' ')
	2)In the StepDefinition replace the data with {string}
	3)Pass the arguments in the method and replace the hardoded data with arguments
