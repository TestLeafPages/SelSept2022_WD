PageObjectModel:
===============
   It is a design pattern to build the framework
Framework:
==========
   The group of testcases which is designed in a pattern or structure
   
Advantages:
==========
    1)Easy maintenance
	2)Increase Productivity]
	3)Maintain uniformity
	4)Reduce duplicate code
	5)Better reporting


Steps for POM:
=====
   1)Create BaseClass for common variables and methods
   2)Create Java classes for each page that we navigate in the application
   3)All the java classes for pages should extends BaseClass  
   4)Create methods for each action in the respective classes for pages 
   5)Each method in the pages should have return type based on where the control goes after the action
   6)Create a java class for testcase and extends with BaseClass   
	 
Steps for Parallel Execution:
==============================
   1)Remove static from driver in the BaseClass	 
   2)Create public constructor in all the pages with ChromeDriver as argument
   3)Assign the local variable to the global variable(this.driver=driver)
   4)Pass the driver in the constructor call (testcases+pages)
